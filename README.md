My first project using Spring Boot for creating a basic Student Management System RESTful API with implemented request with real PostgreSQL database. 
The project represents a Rest API application featuring a working Back End and Front End with Boostrap collections.

Project development is in progress as there are still many things to be added and changed.
These are the first steps finished towards making a full on application.
